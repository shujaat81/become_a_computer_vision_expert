The following are covered in the notebooks.

* **Python** is a high level programming language that has got a lot of popularity and with the rapid growth of the libraries and frameworks, this is a right programming language to do Computer Vision tasks.

* **NumPy** is a scientific computing tool used for array or matrix operations. 

* **Pandas** is a great and simple tool for analyzing and manipulating data from a variety of different sources.

* **Matplotlib** is a comprehensive data visualization tool used to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

* **TensorFlow** for neural networks: TensorFlow is a popular deep learning framework used for building models suitable for different fields such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.
